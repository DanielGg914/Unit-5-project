                    About us
                </h3>

                <p>
                    We are an all-female law public safety team who believe that women are overlooked in the
                    public safety field. We started our company to prove that women can do anything that a man
                    can do and look good while doing it. It is run by four female highly trained professional women
                    who had a dream to show what we are capable. Our company was started in 2020 and is ran by
                    Yahaira Lopez, Mackenzie Evinger, Kimberly Cordova, and Michelle Fuentes.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    
                </h3>

                <p>
                    As women, we have a lot of places to hide things such as weapons. We are discrete with our
                    tactics and how we do things. We are all trained security guards so we have the capability of
                    protecting our clientele. People would never expect a group of all females to be the ones
                    defending the celebrities, we use that as an advantage in order to pop out unexpectedly.
                    Our company took the approach to physical security.
